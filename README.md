## Run the app
python3 app.py 
Frontend is built using Flask and HTML

## Languages used
Python 
HTML

## Files structure
app.py renders HTML pages
The rendered pages follow the base.html in templates folder
The templates folder also contains other webpages rendered in the app that extend base.html
The static folder contains the output files that are written to by app.py, and the plots generated by app.py
These output files and plots are embedded in the webpages rendered by app.py
Misc folder contains some codes that help understand the dataset

## Dataset
Use only the dataset given i.e. cars_engage_2022.csv
The source code app.py is written specific to this dataset and is not flexible to accomodate other datasets
It is also not flexible in column indices, it is specific to this colum format

## Future Scope
The web app as of now only performs feature wise analysis
Future scope is to implement row wise analysis, input validation using AI, and flexibity to analyse different datasets
