## Run the app
python3 app.py\
Frontend is built using Flask and HTML  < br/>

## Languages used
Python  < br/>
HTML  < br/>

## Files structure
app.py renders HTML pages  < br/>
The rendered pages follow the base.html in templates folder  < br/>
The templates folder also contains other webpages rendered in the app that extend base.html  < br/>
The static folder contains the output files that are written to by app.py, and the plots generated by app.py  < br/>
These output files and plots are embedded in the webpages rendered by app.py  < br/>
Misc folder contains some codes that help understand the dataset  < br/>

## Dataset
Use only the dataset given i.e. cars_engage_2022.csv  < br/>
The source code app.py is written specific to this dataset and is not flexible to accomodate other datasets  < br/>
It is also not flexible in column indices, it is specific to this colum format  < br/>

## Future Scope
The web app as of now only performs feature wise analysis < br/>
Future scope is to implement row wise analysis, input validation using AI, and flexibity to analyse different datasets  < br/>
